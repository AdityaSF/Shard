## Overview
Shard was created because, as I was making a lot of commands, \
I realized how tedious it is to make subcommands. Shard \
supports not only subcommands, but more vanilla style commands \
with no subcommands.

## Features
* Simple subcommand structure
* New tab completion API
* Vanilla style commands for simple command uses
